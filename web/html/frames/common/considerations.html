                Communication between Merchant and AstroPay should be made by POST.
            </li>
            <li>
                The protocol used is purely HTTPS.
            </li>
            <li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Credentials must be used in all communications. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Both parties must use an HMAC-SHA-256 (RFC 2104) code to verify the integrity of the information received from each side.

                HMAC‐SHA‐256 code (32 bytes) is generated using a key provided by AstroPay. This code is converted to string as a hexadecimal representation of the code (64 upper chars).

                All communications between Merchant and AstroPay should be made exclusively through registered IPs on both sides.
